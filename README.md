# Computer-Technology-Vocabulary

开发思路：
1. 在 wordlist.dat 中添加单词列表【废弃】
2. 调用 API  获取单词发音、定义、翻译、备注等信息
3. 填充到 README.md 中，table 排序

添加单词：``wordadd ==> php path/to/project/index.php``
```shell
wordadd MySQL
```



###  进度

- 发音【完成】
- 音译【完成】，取常用翻译【待完成】
- 写 README.md 【完成】
- 中译【待开发】
- 去重【待开发】
- 排序【待开发】
- 自动提交【待开发】
